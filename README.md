## Task description ##

> Implement a method that takes an array of integers and filters it in such a way that the output will be a new array consisting only of elements that are palindromes. If there are no such elements return an empty array.   
> **Do not use LINQ queries and delegates**.   
> Develop NUnit tests methods. It is mandatory that there are tests that verify the operation of the method on arrays of large dimension.
