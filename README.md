## Task description ##

 - Implement a method that takes an array of integers and filters it in such a way that the output will be a new array consisting only of elements that are [palindromes](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/palindromic-number.git). If there are no such elements return an empty array. **Do not use LINQ queries and delegates**.        
 - Develop NUnit tests methods.   
 - Develop tests that test the method on large arrays.
